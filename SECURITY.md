2. **Notify Us Privately:** Report the vulnerability privately to our security team by emailing us at [team.fringecore@gmail.com](mailto:team.fringecore@gmail.com). If you are concerned about the sensitivity of the information you are sharing, you can use our [PGP key](#pgp-key) to encrypt your communication.

    - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
